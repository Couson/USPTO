Each of the strips of material are connected to the layer of base fabric in overlapping layers whereby the base fabric is covered. The protective composite fabric further includes a resilient elastically deformable material having at least one sensor therein for monitoring of vital signs of a wearer, the resilient elastically deformable material being connected with the at least one layer of a base fabric and the rigid fabric.'],\n",

       "     {'text': 'DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART'},\n",
       "     {'text': 'It is well known that various stab resistant articles or garments, such as ballistic vests, have been worn by prison corrections officers and other types of security, military or law enforcement personnel, and have even been developed for working animals such as dogs or horses. Such stab resistant articles are designed to prevent bodily penetration as a result of stabbing or slashing from sharp objects or weapons. Unfortunately, these protective articles were generally rigid shields which were externally worn and were constructed of heavy, bulky and inflexible metal components such as titanium or other extremely hard metal alloys. The metallic composition of these cumbersome external vest shields must be of sufficient thickness, rigidity and strength to stop impacts imparted by an attacker.'},\n",
       "     {'text': 'Disadvantageously, the bulk and rigidity of such metallic vest garments rendered it uncomfortable to wear. Furthermore, it is rather difficult for the wearer of a rigid vest to move and maneuver around quickly and easily, which is important especially if the wearer is being attacked. Accordingly, such known puncture resistant articles often prove to be ineffective predominantly due to the fact that the potential wearer prefers not to wear the bulky torso shield, rather than tolerating its discomfort, as when used for extended periods such items can be hot and heavy.'},\n",
       "     {'text': 'Another, and perhaps a more significant problem with such types of rigid metallic alloy puncture resistant vests, is that they were not concealable. These known cumbersome shield vests were almost exclusively externally worn and even if they were not worn externally, the bulky nature of such articles make it obvious to a would be attacker that the wearer (corrections officer, etc.) is wearing a protective puncture or stab resistant metallic shield vest. Since the worn vest article cannot be concealed the potential attacker is more prone to stab or slash at a vital area away from the vest such as the lower abdomen, groin, neck or head area. Not only is any element of surprise on the part of the wearer removed by the unconcealed nature of such cumbersome rigid vests, it is highly impractical if not impossible for the undercover personnel to wear such bulky items, and even if used these items offer little to no protection of other body parts such as the arms and legs, damage to which can and do cause severe, life threatening wounds. For example, wounds to the femoral artery can and often kill the person, because there is no protective gear for this area.'},\n",
       "     {'text': \"Moreover, protective devices, such as vests, do exist for working animals, such as dogs, but these tend to be heavy. Ballistic vests are currently the only garment available to protect against ballistic and sharp objects, and a ballistic vest can weigh from 15-20 pounds. For a working dog of 80-125 pounds, such a ballistic vest is equivalent to roughly 20% of that animal's body weight and wearing such a heavy item can increase the body temperature of the animal or wearer. In hot climates, for example, working dogs can easily overheat and expire when their body temperature increases 3-5 degrees, a risk which is enhanced if conventional ballistic vests are utilized. In some cases, dogs have refuse to move when wearing this heavy gear. As such it would be beneficial to monitor the vital signs of the wearer, whether it be a working animal, such as a dog, to a person wearing the material. Particularly in the case of a working animal, an ideal protective composite fabric would be one the animal would wear around the chest or neck, as part of a uniform or single unit. The animal would be able to move about freely and without cumbersome cables, and, when the animal is nearing a dangerous level for any of the vitals being monitored, the handler or keeper or central station would be alerted to attend to the animal that is under stress before the animal's health is compromised or expiration occurs.\"},\n",
